## Libraries

- [Turbo Pack](https://github.com/TurboPack)
  Open source, community maintained projects for use with Embarcadero's RAD Studio, Delphi and C++Builder.

## Logging

- [loggerpro](https://github.com/danieleteti/loggerpro)
  An modern and pluggable logging framework for Delphi

## Events

- [Delphi Event Bus](https://github.com/spinettaro/delphi-event-bus)
  (for short DEB) is a publish/subscribe Event Bus framework for the Delphi platform. DEB is designed to decouple different parts/layers of your application while still allowing them to communicate efficiently. It was inspired by EventBus framework for the Android platform.

## Threading

- [OmniThreadLibrary](https://github.com/gabr42/OmniThreadLibrary)
  A simple and powerful multithreading library for Delphi. It supports Delphi versions from 2007 to the latest and is released under the BSD license.
  OmniThreadLibrary's main "selling" points (besides the prices, of course ;) are power, simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not powerful enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness" and replace it with your own code.

## Serialization

- [https://github.com/JensBorrisholt/Delphi-JsonToDelphiClass](https://github.com/JensBorrisholt/Delphi-JsonToDelphiClass)
  Generates Delphi Classes based on JSON string (Json To Delphi Class Generator / JSON Data Binding Tool)

## Cryptography

- [TurboPack LockBox3](https://github.com/TurboPack/LockBox3)
  LockBox3 is a Delphi library for cryptography.
  It provides support for AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, SHA, MD5, a variety of chaining modes, RSA digital signature and verific... It includes designtime and runtime packages for Delphi and C++Builder and supports VCL, FMX, Win32, Win64, macOS, iOS, and Android.

## Compression

- [Abbrevia](https://github.com/TurboPack/Abbrevia)
  Abbrevia is a compression toolkit for Delphi and C++Builder. It supports compressing and decompressing PKZIP, Microsoft CAB, tar, gzip, and bzip2 archives, and can create self-extracting executables. On Windows it also provides Delphi wrappers for the LZMA, Bzip2, and WavPack SDKs, and PPMd decompression.

### Graphics

- [SVGIconImageList](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList)
  Three engines to render SVG (GDI+, Direct2D or Cairo) and four components to simplify use of SVG images (resize, fixedcolor, grayscale...)
- [PNGComponents](https://github.com/TurboPack/PNGComponents)
  PngComponents is a set of components that allows you to include in your application real PNG files. You can read more about them in the Doku subfolder. This is a source-only release of TurboPack PNGComponents. It includes designtime and runtime packages for Delphi and C++Builder and supports Win32 and Win64.

## QR-code

- [Easily Generate QR Code Images From Text On Windows In Delphi](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/easily-generate-qr-code-images-from-text-on-windows-in-delphi/)
  If you need to include the generation of QR barcode images in your Delphi application, you might want to take a look at open source “DelphiZXingQRCode” – a Delphi port of the QR Code functionality in ZXing, an open source barcode image processing library.
  - [GitHub: DelphiZXingQRCode](https://github.com/foxitsoftware/DelphiZXingQRCode)
    Delphi port of QR Code functionality from ZXing, a barcode image processing library.

## Math

- [FastMath - Fast Math Library for Delphi](https://github.com/neslib/FastMath)
  FastMath is a Delphi math library that is optimized for fast performance (sometimes at the cost of not performing error checking or losing a little accuracy). It uses hand-optimized assembly code to achieve much better performance then the equivalent functions provided by the Delphi RTL.

## Communication

- [NetCom7](https://github.com/DelphiBuilder/NetCom7)
  The fastest communications possible.  
  This set of components is the fastest possible implementation of socket communications, in any language; this is an extremely optimised code on TCP/IP sockets. Forget using a thread per connection: With this suite you can have as many concurrent connections to your server as you like. Threads are used per request and not per connection, and are maintained in a very fast thread pool class.  
  The implementation begins with TncTCPServer and TncTCPClient which implements the basic socket communications. You can use TncTCPClient and TncTCPServer if all you want is to implement standard (but very fast) socket comms.

## Web

- [MCH_Delphi_Software](https://github.com/MartinCHarvey/MCH_Delphi_Software)
  Delphi Instagram and Twitter Client, Analytics, and Misc library code
