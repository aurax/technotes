- [Definition of Done vs Acceptance Criteria](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/definition-of-done-vs-acceptance-criteria/)
  **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a list of requirements that a user story must adhere to for the team to call it complete. While the **Acceptance Criteria** of a User Story consist of set of Test Scenarios that are to be met to confirm that the software is working as expected.  
  The difference between these two is that *the DoD is common for all the User Stories whereas the Acceptance Criteria is applicable to specific User Story*. Acceptance Criteria of each User Story will be different based on the requirements of that User Story.
