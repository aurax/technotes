## Xamarin.Forms

- [XAML Previewer for Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-previewer/)
  The XAML Previewer shows you how your Xamarin.Forms XAML page will look on iOS and Android. When you make changes to your XAML, you'll see them previewed immediately alongside your code. The XAML Previewer is available in Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac.
- [XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/hot-reload)
  XAML Hot Reload plugs into your existing workflow to increase your productivity and save you time. Without XAML Hot Reload, you have to build and deploy your app every time you want to see a XAML change. With Hot Reload, when you save your XAML file the changes are reflected live in your running app. In addition, your navigation state and data will be maintained, enabling you to quickly iterate on your UI without losing your place in the app. Therefore, with XAML Hot Reload, you'll spend less time rebuilding and deploying your apps to validate UI changes.

## Xamarin.Android

- [Using the Xamarin.Android Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/user-interface/android-designer/designer-walkthrough)
  Android user interfaces can be created declaratively by using XML files or programmatically by writing code. The Xamarin.Android Designer allows developers to create and modify declarative layouts visually, without requiring hand-editing of XML files.
