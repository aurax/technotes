## Common

- [The Flat Assembler](http://flatassembler.net/)
  (abbreviated to fasm, intentionally stylized with lowercase letters) is a fast assembler running in a variety of operating systems, in continued development since 1999. It was designed primarily for the assembly of x86 instructions and it supports x86 and x86-64 instructions sets with extensions like MMX, 3DNow!, SSE up to SSE4, AVX, AVX2, XOP, and AVX-512. It can produce output in plain binary, MZ, PE, COFF or ELF format. It includes a powerful but simple macroinstruction system and does multiple passes to optimize the size of instruction codes. The flat assembler is self-hosting and the complete source code is included.
