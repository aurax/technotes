  Outside of Unity, C# is rarely used as a game programming language. C++ is used heavily in Unreal, Cryengine, Lumberyard, and almost all proprietary game studio engines. This series is for Unity game programmers who know C# and want to broaden their skills so they can effectively write code for other engines, or even write C++ scripts for Unity.
