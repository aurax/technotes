## Architecture

- [Outside the MVVM Pattern?](https://delphiprofi.blogspot.com/2021/01/outside-mvvm-pattern.html)
  In the past, I always thought the Model is a class closely related to the MVVM pattern... However, this is not really the case. The model should be able to send notifications or must be able to do some data mapping, but in a real-world application, the Model should be YOUR Class - perhaps implementing some interfaces if necessary.
