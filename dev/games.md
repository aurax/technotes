## C++ libraries

- [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)
  EnTT is a header-only, tiny and easy to use library for game programming and much more written in modern C++. Among others, it's used in Minecraft by Mojang, the ArcGIS Runtime SDKs by Esri and the amazing Ragdoll Autodesk Maya plugin.  
  It's mainly known for its entity-component-system (ECS) model. However, it offers also [many other things](https://github.com/skypjack/entt#introduction) useful during development, from flexible tools for managing signals to an integrated reflection system and so on.  
  EnTT is also a production-ready, fully documented and a battle-tested library with a 100% coverage. [Among others](https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki/EnTT-in-Action), it's currently used in Minecraft by Mojang and the ArcGIS Runtime SDK by Esri.
